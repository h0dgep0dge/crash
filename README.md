A simple physics engine in TypeScript
I decided to write this one evening while on the phone to one @turbo-hipster. I needed a project to let me learn about TypeScript, it should be well suited to OOP and be browser based. Naturally, a physics simulator came to mind. Henceforth, therefore, ontoward, and hereafter, crash was born.
